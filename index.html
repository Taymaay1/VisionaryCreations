									<h2><a href="#">Introduction</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Taylor Mason, and I am a creator. I specialize in a variety of creations. However, to be honest it is very challenging at times having multiple talents within digital work but not knowing which to perfect for the best fitting job that will give me a chance to elevate their company. UI development or user interface development, process of developing web applications, mobile application and software development has been my biggest progress. Brand marketing has also been a acomplishment for me as well. Within this portfolio I will be presenting some of my works and all were made from scratch. And lastly this portfolio websites was made by me. Enjoy.</p>

									<p>Here are a few projects I used to practice on my CSS and HTML techniqes. I used many differnt styles within each index. However, these projects were some of my very first attempts with creating any HTML language and CSS styles. I presrent the basic techniques, a lot of variety, tables, color, font sizes, transitions and much more.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Creative Marketing Strategies<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/cme.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Here I showcase my creativity for public marketing. Also, I present here my own company, CME Productions, which stands for Creative Minds Expansion. I have been doing some buisness planning for the past 3 years on my production company. Many ideas are all over the place. However, its purpose and influence is concrete; provide a space within the neighborhood for creators to create and expand. CME Productions eventually will be a place where all creators can come to create. Whether it is music recording/engenering, marketing, logos, covers, photography, video augraphy, clothing prints and designs, edits and website and content development. Essentially within that space all of these different type of creators can collaborate or feed off one another. Lastly, within CME Production I plan to create its own music streaming platform open for all artst, but targeted for growing underground music artist. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Bread Buisness APP and<br />
										Maze game prototype</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/app.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Here is a rough draft version of a phone APP I made for a bread company. For this specific project I used Adobe XD. Started off by building the application's wireframes and mockups and then incorporated the users interactions. The whole concept of this project was to demonstrate and create a  user friendly application to purchase the bread company's products. Then lastly, using UNITY I created a game prototype. It displays a figure just completing and getting through a maze.</p>
